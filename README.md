Computer Graphics Project: Video Craft

The current methods of viewing videos on web browser are highly non-interactive leaving 
users with nothing interesting to do. Passive actions such as laying back and watching 
leave the user thirsty for action. We aim to enrich and enhance the video viewing 
experience, focusing specifically on music videos. The generated graphics, combined with
videoâ€™s own frames and strong synchronization with music, all three in perfect harmony, 
should provide a rich and fun music visualization experience to the end-user.

Exploration of the various facets and functionalities that WebGL provides, augmenting the
basic backbone of JavaScript, deepens own understanding of WebGL. Our work would 
mainly involve concepts including audio-based graphics rendering, compositing frames of 
videos with varying opacity, spatial distribution of music (location based music).

Every musical score has linked audio, which can be used to construct a dynamic 
visualization. This is done on a regular basis on media players such as: Windows Media 
Player, WinAmp etc, though these visualizations are mostly 2D. We will try to incorporate
3D visualization of the audio using WebGL dynamically. Combining this with the frames of 
the music video, we will create a navigable 3D space with graphics being generated 
according to the beats and tempo of the music.

Furthermore, several song tracks can be played in different parts of 3D space 
simultaneously, with a fusion effect when one navigates from one part of space to 
another.
